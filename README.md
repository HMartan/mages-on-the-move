# Mages on the Move
Mages on the Move will be desktop application for building and testing the maps, cards, abilities (everything) for the boarding game Mages on the Move. This boarding game was also invented by me.

Some planned features:
- Maps will be playable in the application.
- AI (NPC) will be implemented. It will be possible to:
  - use AI players in a game as opponents;
  - use AI players for automatic testing of maps, cards and abilities;
- The user will be able to export maps and cards to image files or to print them. This way the user will be able to easily create the boarding game from his/her map.
